 abstract = {We study the problem of estimating the ridges of a density function. Ridge estimation is an extension of mode finding and is useful for understanding the structure of a density. It can also be used to find hidden structure in point cloud data. We show that, under mild regularity conditions, the ridges of the kernel density estimator consistently estimate the ridges of the true density. When the data are noisy measurements of a manifold, we show that the ridges are close and topologically similar to the hidden manifold. To find the estimated ridges in practice, we adapt the modified mean-shift algorithm proposed by Ozertem and Erdogmus [J. Mach. Learn. Res. 12 (2011) 1249-1286]. Some numerical experiments verify that the algorithm is accurate.},

 abstract = {For functional data lying on an unknown nonlinear low-dimensional space, we study manifold learning and introduce the notions of manifold mean, manifold modes of functional variation and of functional manifold components. These constitute nonlinear representations of functional data that complement classical linear representations such as eigenfunctions and functional principal components. Our manifold learning procedures borrow ideas from existing nonlinear dimension reduction methods, which we modify to address functional data settings. In simulations and applications, we study examples of functional data which lie on a manifold and validate the superior behavior of manifold mean and functional manifold components over traditional cross-sectional mean and functional principal components. We also include consistency proofs for our estimators under certain assumptions.},

abstract = {Summary Many techniques of functional data analysis require choosing a measure of distance between functions, with the most common choice being distance. In this article we show that using a weighted distance, with a judiciously chosen weight function, can improve the performance of various statistical methods for functional data, including k-medoids clustering, nonparametric classification, and permutation testing. Assuming a quadratically penalized (e.g., spline) basis representation for the functional data, we consider three nontrivial weight functions: design density weights, inverse-variance weights, and a new weight function that minimizes the coefficient of variation of the resulting squared distance by means of an efficient iterative procedure. The benefits of weighting, in particular with the proposed weight function, are demonstrated both in simulation studies and in applications to the Berkeley growth data and a functional magnetic resonance imaging data set.},

    abstract = "{Motivation: Temporal gene expression profiles provide an important characterization of gene function, as biological systems are predominantly developmental and dynamic. We propose a method of classifying collections of temporal gene expression curves in which individual expression profiles are modeled as independent realizations of a stochastic process. The method uses a recently developed functional logistic regression tool based on functional principal components, aimed at classifying gene expression curves into known gene groups. The number of eigenfunctions in the classifier can be chosen by leave-one-out cross-validation with the aim of minimizing the classification error.Results: We demonstrate that this methodology provides low-error-rate classification for both yeast cell-cycle gene expression profiles and Dictyostelium cell-type specific gene expression patterns. It also works well in simulations. We compare our functional principal components approach with a B-spline implementation of functional discriminant analysis for the yeast cell-cycle data and simulations. This indicates comparative advantages of our approach which uses fewer eigenfunctions/base functions. The proposed methodology is promising for the analysis of temporal gene expression data and beyond.Availability: MATLAB programs are available upon request.Contact:ileng@wfubmc.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary materials are available on the journal's website.}",

For this one needs to impose a Riemannian structure on the spaces formed by these functions. We propose a "spherical" version of the Fisher-Rao metric that provides closed-form expressions for geodesics and distances, and allows fast computation of sample statistics. To demonstrate this approach, we present an application in planar shape classification.}
